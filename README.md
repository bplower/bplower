
Heya! :wave:

I'm Brahm. I'm a software engineer, but also more broadly I am a curious mind. I get paid to design systems and write code, but my fundamental skill is learning quickly and proactivaly growing my expertise however it's needed.

I also have a [blog](https://brahmlower.io), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/brahmlower), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brahm-lower).

My github is mostly a dumping ground of unfinished weekend projects and experiments. Most of these are not polished (they don't even have CI set up :scream:), and typically only serve one of the following purposes:

* test a hypothesis
* path-finding to assist learning something new
* explore a creative idea/scenario

There are a few projects that I quite enjoy though, so I thought they're worth highlighting here:

* [Status-Page Monitor](https://github.com/bplower/statuspage-monitor)
* [Postgres Virtual Tables](https://github.com/bplower/postgres-virtual-tables)
* [Airbrake Rust](https://github.com/kyrylo/airbrake-rust)
* [Loot Generator](https://github.com/bplower/loot-generator)
* [Test Galaxy Map](https://github.com/bplower/test-galaxy-map)

My professional work is generally closed source so I can't link to repos in most cases, but I have shipped products that I can reference! :wink:

My most recent work has been creating, delivering and expanding [OneLogin Smart Hooks](https://developers.onelogin.com/api-docs/2/smart-hooks/overview), which enables workflow customization within existing OneLogin products/features.
