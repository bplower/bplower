
## Heya, I'm Brahm! 👋

I'm a senior software engineer with a focus on backend services and systems design. I prefer brevity, explicitness and self discovery in my tools, and have consequently grown to love Rust, Go, HTMX, and Tailwind, among a myriad of other daily utilities.

### Personal Portfolio 🙌

My repos are typically experiments or incomplete side-projects, but sometimes include actual projects. My public projects generally fall into one these themes:

1. testing a hypothesis
2. assist in learning something new
3. explore a creative idea/scenario

A few projects that I really enjoy and want to highlight are:

- ![project](https://img.shields.io/badge/-project_✨-green) [Today I Learned](https://til.brahmlower.io/) (serverless- give it a sec to cold-start)

### Brief Philosophies 🤔

- I am [Grug](https://grugbrain.dev/)
- [Psychological safety](https://friday.app/p/what-is-psychological-safety) & [managing up](https://www.cultureamp.com/blog/managing-up-importance) are keystones to an effective organization
- Suburbs aren't a culture. We need walkable cities & good public transit
- We're actively killing our planet (fuck greenwashing)
- Our constant-growth for-profit economic systems are unsustainable
- Crypto & web3 are a scams. Don't talk to me about it
- Touch grass 🌱
